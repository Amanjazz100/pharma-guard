## Why This Happened

| Problem | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| Python 3.14 | Too bleeding-edge — most packages don't have wheels for it yet |
| `pydantic-core` compile fail | Needs Rust/Cargo to build from source, Render's filesystem is read-only |
| Fix | Pin to Python 3.11 which has pre-built wheels for all dependencies |

After this fix your build should show:

==> Build successful 🎉
